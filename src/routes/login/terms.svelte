<h1>
	Terms and conditions
</h1>

<p>
	You must abide by the terms and conditions to use IvoryTower.
</p>

<h2>Membership and access</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I understand that this website is not affiliated in any way with any university, academic program, or other similar entity.
	I understand that I am participating in the IvoryTower site of my own free will. Nobody's making me log in.</li>
	<li>I agree to keep my login credentials for the site private, and will take reasonable precautions to
	prevent non-members from accessing it.</li>
	<li>I agree that I may end my membership at any time. At that time, I will lose access to the site’s
	content; however, I am still bound by the non-disclosure rules, because I viewed that content while still
	a member of the site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-disclosure, privacy, and censorship</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I acknowledge that I am using a private discussion forum, and agree not to share content of the
	forums with outside parties, be they friends, faculty, staff, prospective students, or family. The only
	exception is information that is publicly available, such as news articles and links to other sites.
	The foundation of the community is <em>trust</em>, and this rule is absolutely <em>crucial</em>.</li>
	<li>The IvoryTower forums are a community of friends. This has the side effect of stirring up the sort of arguments,
	debates, and pointed jabs that come along with discussion amongst one's peers. I agree to have a good sense
	of humor about what I read. I realize that the moderators have <strong>no</strong> responsibility to censor or otherwise modify
	objectionable forum content, but may do so at their own discretion.</li>
	<li>Since this is a private web community in which I am participating at my own will, I give up any and all rights
	to complain about the site to any party.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conduct</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This document is not a code of conduct; however, I will use good judgment while participating in the site.
	Things that are unacceptable are generally quite <em>obviously</em> unacceptable.</li>
	<li>I understand that administration may restrict or ban users on any grounds they deem necessary to ensure
	the site’s security and the health of the community. Proof or confirmation of any suspected violations of these
	terms and conditions is not necessary. Should I be banned from IvoryTower for any reason, I realize that I will still be
	bound not to disclose any content from the site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If any portion of this agreement is found to be void or otherwise inoperative, the other provisions will remain
	in full effect.</li>
	<li>These terms and conditions will not prevent me from doing anything that may be required by law. But, if unusual
	circumstances apply to me such that I feel might in any way be forced to break these rules (for example, if I am
	required to disclose any knowledge I have of illegal activities), I must inform the administrators immediately.</li>
	<li>These terms and conditions may be changed at any time. If I no longer agree to any new or revised terms
	and conditions, I must discontinue using the site.</li>
	<li>IvoryTower website text and images © Copyright Travis M. Spomer. User-produced content remains the property
	of the original owner unless otherwise noted. Forum posts, including both text and images, remain the property
	of the poster. Poll and survey responses become in aggregate the property of Travis M. Spomer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>You must agree to these terms to use IvoryTower.</h2>
<p>
	If and only if you accept and agree to <strong>all</strong> of the above terms, you may enter this site.
